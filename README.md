# My GitHub Pages Site

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! Currently, it serves as a platform to showcase my resume and professional portfolio. However, I have exciting plans to transform it into a dynamic blog, featuring publications, articles, and more.

## About

This site initially started as a place to display my resume and portfolio, highlighting my skills and experiences. As I continue to develop my web presence, I envision expanding its scope to include regular blog posts covering topics ranging from technology and programming to personal insights and reflections.

## Future Plans

- **Blog**: I plan to start regularly publishing blog posts covering a variety of topics related to my interests and expertise.
- **Publications**: Alongside blog posts, I aim to share any significant publications or projects I undertake.
- **Interactivity**: I'm considering adding interactive elements such as comment sections or forums to encourage engagement and discussion.
- **Design Enhancements**: Improving the overall design and user experience of the site to make it more appealing and accessible.

Stay tuned for updates as I work towards transforming this site into a vibrant hub of content and discussion!
